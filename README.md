# Debloy
Laravel app deployment made easy with automated environment setup. 

This script, when run, will perform the following actions on your server

- Create the web folder for your app
- Create a database for your app
- Create and configure a Nginx host file to server the app
- Create and configure a git-bare repository on the server for the app to manage your code deployments continuously
- Create and configure a post-receive git hooks for the git-bare repository to handle your code deployments (_file permissions,mix compilation, composer packages install updates, code clean up, caching, various post deployments optimization..._)
- Automatically install Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for your app

# General information
**Recommended steps**

- Initial run to set up the full environment
- After the initial run, add the newly created git-bare repo to your code source, the exact command to do this will be displayed like following after the initial run
```
add the remote git bare repository with the following git command 
git remote add production ssh://username@server.domain.com/repositories/debloy.com.git
```
- Make your first push to the server from your local code base to deploy your code. _Only for the first push, Debloy will detect the push and execute the laravel command to generate the app key_.
- After the initial push, you need to update the .env file of the new environment accordingly to your requirements.
- Voil√†! enjoy your newly created app.
